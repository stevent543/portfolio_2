<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>This is the movie that made me the man I am today! I love everything about it!</p>
<h3>Indiana Jones</h3>
<p>This movie inspired me as a child to always seek adventure.  Oh yea, and Indiana is a cool dude!</p>
<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
<p>I am fascinated with pirates and Jack Sparrow is by far the best lead character in any movie..</p>
