<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/me.png" height="100" alt="pic of steve"><br />
<p>Hi there! I'm a 55-year-old married father of three now adult children, and life is never boring in our household, especially with three dogs running around. I’ve always had a deep love for animals and the outdoors, and I try to live a life full of creativity, connection, and exploration.</p>

<p>For the past 20 years, I’ve been a middle school computer teacher, blending my passion for technology and education. In addition to teaching, I serve as my school’s tech support specialist and direct our school’s studio band—something I truly love. Music has always been a major part of my life. I've played in several rock bands over the years and recently picked up the trumpet again after a 30-year break. These days, I’m diving deep into jazz and chill alternative music..</p>

<p>My role at school also extends beyond the classroom. As the Director of Outdoor Education, I organize and lead student wilderness trips, helping young people connect with nature through backpacking, canoeing, and camping adventures.</p>
<p>Outside of school, I’m a passionate videographer and editor. I’ve owned several video production businesses and still take on freelance work, as well as producing videos for my school. It’s a creative outlet that complements my love for tech and storytelling.</p>
<p>When I'm not in front of a computer or behind a camera, you'll likely find me mountain biking, hiking, kayaking, or sailing. The outdoors is my reset button and a big part of who I am.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I plan to retire from teaching in about eight years. My goal is to shift into a remote-friendly career, whether from home, a hotel, or even a camper, doing web development and other digital creative work. That’s exactly why I’m taking this course: to learn, grow, and prepare for the next chapter.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me!</p>
